# Movement Sandbox

This project is for testing out several features, mainly 3D movement with some modifiers.

## This example project contains

- 3D movement template with proper rotation and movement in zero gravity and gradual jumping
- A test course to feel out the movement of the character
- A character with animations rigged and fully working
- 1st and 3rd person camera with collision
- Barebones visuals and sounds

## How to play

- WASD for movement
- SPACE to jump (holding makes you go higher)
- Scroll down to zoom the camera out, scroll up to zoom camera in
- LMB to shoot a repelling pellet
- In zero gravity, press E or Q to rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise

## Credits
These are all the tools and assets I used in this project. Previously a 3D Character controller from Godot's Asset Library was also used, as can be seen in this repository's history, however, it was later discarded in favour of a custom solution.
